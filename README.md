## VRPolarsChart
The **Chart Application** has been developed to display the boats polars of the [Virtual Regatta Offshore](https://www.virtualregatta.com/)<sup>®</sup> online game.
It also provides a custom polars generator for those using third-party routers.


The **Chart Application** provides an _HTTP GET API_ so you can call it from a third party application or from an extension like the [VR Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vr-dashboard/amknkhejaogpekncjekiaolgldbejjan).

However, it is not designed nor expected to be used in real life navigation.
